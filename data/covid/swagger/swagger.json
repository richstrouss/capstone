This is made possible by using C3.ai Types.\n\nIf you are new to the concept of a C3.ai Type, then it is easier to think of a C3.ai Type as an entity that holds the data. Using C3.ai Types makes it possible to programmatically interact with a unified, federated image of COVID-19 data.\n\nOn this page, entries such as OutbreakLocation, LineListRecord are the names of C3.ai Types. Each C3.ai Type holds data of a certain kind. For example:\n  - OutbreakLocation stores location data such as countries, provinces, cities, where COVID-19 outbeaks are recorded, and\n  - LineListRecord stores individual-level information such as symptoms, travel history,  reported onset, and discharge status from laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients.\n\nWhile each such C3.ai Type holds the data of a particular kind, you can use these APIs to connect up the data from multiple C3.ai Types. For example, you can join the data from two C3.ai Types, [BiologicalAsset](#tag/BiologicalAsset) and [Sequence](#tag/Sequence). This can be accomplished by using the `include` option in the fetch API call.\n\nThe following is an example entity relationship diagram showing how C3.ai Types are connected. Not all fields are shown in the below diagram. Refer to the **Fields** table for a C3.ai Type for a full listing of the fields for that C3.ai Type. See, for example, [LineListRecord](#tag/LineListRecord).\n\n[![C3.ai COVID-19 Data Model](/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/C3-ai-COVIDDL-DataModel.svg)](/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/C3-ai-COVIDDL-DataModel.svg)\n\n## Fetching from Multiple Sources\n\nThe `include` parameter is a powerful way to fetch data from multiple C3.ai Types. This parameter can also be used to fetch specific fields from a single C3.ai Type.\n\nWhen you want to join data from two C3.ai Types, you make a fetch API call to one C3.ai Type, and use `include` in your request body to refer to the second C3.ai Type. The returned objects will contain fields and data from both the C3.ai Types.\n\nSee the section [Using Include](#section/Using-C3.ai-APIs/Using-Include) for detailed examples showing how to use `include` to combine data from multiple C3.ai Types.\n\n# C3.ai APIs for COVID-19 Unified Data\n\nThe following APIs are currently suppported:\n\n- `fetch` (for all C3.ai Types presented here)\n- `evalmetrics` (for [OutbreakLocation](#tag/OutbreakLocation))\n- `getprojectionhistory` (for [OutbreakLocation](#tag/OutbreakLocation))\n- `getarticlemetadata` (for [BiblioEntry](#tag/BiblioEntry))\n- `getimageurls` (for [Diagnosis](#tag/Diagnosis))\n- `allversionsforpolicy` (for [LocationPolicySummary](#tag/LocationPolicySummary))\n\nUse `POST` requests to access these APIs.\n\n> **NOTE**: If you are new to the concept of RESTful API, this <a href=\"https://learning.postman.com/getting-started/\" target=\"_blank\">Postman Learning Center</a> is a good place to start. All APIs described in this documentation can be verified using the Postman client.\n\nThe following table shows the APIs available for specific data sources (more data sources are being added):\n\n|

No authentication token is required to access the APIs.\n\n## Required Headers\nAll C3.ai APIs described in this documentation must be used with the following header settings:\n\n| Headers| Setting |\n|-------------|----------|\n| Accept | application/json |\n| Content-Type | application/json |\n\n\n## Using Fetch\n\nThe request JSON for the `fetch` API should be used with the `filter` key. This `filter` key can be used in the fetch call to select any combination of the fields in the data. A few examples follow:\n\n>**IMPORTANT**: For a list of fields available for a C3.ai Type, refer to the fields section of that C3.ai Type in this document.\n\n  To fetch the data that match the specific values of the `id` field of the data:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"spec\" : {\"filter\": 'id == \"Afghanistan\"'}\n  }\n  ```\n  A few other examples:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"spec\" : {\"filter\": 'id == \"Afghanistan\" && age == 45'}\n  }\n  ```\n  or,\n\n  ```json\n  {  // See BiologicalAsset\n    \"spec\": {\n    \t\"filter\": \"isolationSource == 'feces' && location == 'Japan'\",\n    \t\"limit\": -1\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n  or, using a `\"contains(field, \"string\")\"` format:\n\n  ```json\n  { // See LineListRecord\n    \"spec\": {\n    \t\"filter\": \"gender == 'male' && lineListSource == 'OPEN' && age <= 20 && contains(relevantTravelHistoryLocation,'Wuhan')\"\n   }\n  }\n  ```\n\nThe `fetch` API returns two main kinds of information in its response:\n\n  - The data from the C3.ai Type, fetched as an array of the objects.\n  - Metadata, or data describing data, such as:\n      - The number of objects fetched.\n      - Number of rows of information.\n      - An indicator if more data exists in the C3.ai Type that was not returned.\n  - See the section [Limits](#section/Using-C3.ai-APIs/Limits) for the number of entries returned per `fetch` API call.\n\nFor full details on request and response JSON, see the several examples provided in the `fetch` API for all the C3.ai Types in this documentation.\n\n## Using Include\n\nIn a C3.ai Type, the data type of a field can be a C3.ai Type. For example, the field `links` in [TherapeuticAsset](#tag/TherapeuticAsset) is of the type [ExternalLink](#tag/ExternalLink). This is how these two C3.ai Types are connected.\n\nFor example, to join data from these two connected C3.ai Types, TherapeuticAsset and ExternalLink, use the `include` parameter as follows:\n\n- Make a `fetch` API call to TherapeuticAsset.\n- The field `links` in TherapeuticAsset is of ExternalLink Type. Using the dot notation on the `links` field, you can access any field in the ExternalLink. For example, specifying `links.url` will resolve into `ExternalLink.url`, which will obtain the `url` field data from the ExternalLink.\n- Notice that we have not issued a fetch call to ExternalLink. See the full fetch example, including the response objects, below.\n\n\n<h3>Example 1: Join data from TherapeuticAsset and ExternalLink (click arrow to open)</h3>\n<details>\n  <summary>Example 1:

}\n  ```\n\n\n## Using EvalMetrics\n\nWhile the `fetch` API returns the raw data, the `evalmetrics` API returns time series data based on the metrics expression you provide. Metrics are instructions you can provide in the request JSON of the `evalmetrics` API for how to transform the data into time series data. The `evalmetrics` API will then return the resulting time series data.\n\nThe following fields are supported in the request JSON of the `evalmetrics` API:\n\n>**IMPORTANT:** Limits apply to these fields. See [Limits.](#section/Using-C3.ai-APIs/Limits)\n  - **ids:** This is the list of source objects on which you want to evaluate the metrics on. For example: `\"ids\": [\"King_Washington_UnitedStates\",\"SanDiego_California_UnitedStates\"]`.\n  - **expressions:** Here you place a list of the metrics that you wish to evaluate. For example, `\"expressions\":[\"NYT_ConfirmedCases\"]`. See the [EvalMetrics section](#tag/OutbreakLocation/paths/~1api~11~1outbreaklocation~1evalmetrics/post) for a list of supported metrics.\n  - **start** and **end:** The datetime fields where you can put the start and end dates of the period for which you want to evaluate your metrics. For example, `\"start\":\"2020-03-01\"` and  `\"end\":\"2020-03-30\"`.\n  - **interval:** The desired interval for the time series output. For example, `\"interval\":\"DAY\"`.\n\n>**IMPORTANT:** Depending on the raw data , the available time ranges and frequencies of data vary across data sources. Please refer to the detailed metric documentation in the [EvalMetrics section](#tag/OutbreakLocation/paths/~1api~11~1outbreaklocation~1evalmetrics/post) for each data source to set suitable time ranges and interval for your `evalmetrics` call.\n\nThe response JSON for the `evalmetrics` API consists of the time series data array, the timestamp array, and an array consisting of the fraction of data missing from the time series.\n\nThe `missing` array in the `evalmetrics` response JSON can be useful to determine whether the requested time range lies partially outside the available range for a particular metric. Each value in this array corresponds to the percentage availability of data in a particular time interval in the timeseries requested. For example, `0` represents no data missing; `100` represents 100% data in the interval missing.\n\nNote the following when using the `evalmetrics` API:\n1. The `evalmetrics` request body should be used with the `spec` key, just as in a `fetch` request.\n1. The `end` date field in the JSON request acts as an open interval. That is, if `end` is set to “2020-04-04”, then only the data upto and including April 3rd is returned. If you need the data for April 4th, then you must set `end` date to “2020-04-05\".\n1. Data from a few locations, such as countries and states, are the aggregate of data from more granular locations, such as counties. For example, in the JHU Dataset, there is no data for the number of confirmed cases in California. This value is computed by adding the number of cases across all counties in California.\n\nRefer to the several examples provided in the `evalmetrics` API for [OutbreakLocation](#tag/OutbreakLocation) for full details on response JSON.\n\n## Limits\n\n### Fetch Limits\n\nIf `limit` is not specified in the request body, then by default 2000 rows, or less if the available data is less than 2000 rows, are returned. Most APIs return only a limited number of rows even if the `limit` setting is higher or is -1. These maximum limits are shown in the table below.\n\nUse the `offset` parameter to fetch more rows. For example, [see Example 6 for Python in LineListRecord](#tag/LineListRecord/paths/~1api~11~1linelistrecord~1fetch/post).\n\n| API | Limit |\n|-------------|----------|\n| BiblioEntry: `/api/1/biblioentry/fetch` |  2000  |\n| PopulationData: `/api/1/populationdata/fetch` |  2000  |\n| LaborDetail: `/api/1/labordetail/fetch` |  2000  |\n| LineListRecord: `/api/1/linelistrecord/fetch` | 5000 |\n| Sequence: `/api/1/sequence/fetch` | 8000 |\n| Subsequence: `/api/1/subsequence/fetch` | 8000  |\n| BiologicalAsset: `/api/1/biologicalasset/fetch` | 8000 |\n\n### EvalMetrics Limits\n\n| Setting | Limit |\n|-------------|----------|\n| `start`| Start datetime of the time range must be no earlier than 50 years ago from the present day. For example: '1990-01-01'.|\n| `end` | End datetime of the time range must be no earlier than the `start` datetime specified.|\n| `interval` | `DAY`, `MONTH`, and `YEAR` are supported.|\n| `ids` | The number of `ids` specified in this array must be less or equal to 10.|\n| `expressions` | The number of `expressions` specified in this array must be less than or equal to 4.|\n\n### GetArticleMetadata Limits\n\n| Setting | Limit |\n|-------------|----------|\n| `ids` | The number of `ids` specified in this array must be less than or equal to 10.|\n"

Wild rats abundant in urban environments may transmit diseases to humans and other animals, including laboratory rodents used for biomedical research in research facilities, possibly compromising research data. In order to gather information about the various diseases present around such facilities, it is important to conduct routine surveillance of wild rodents in the area. In this pilot study, we surveyed 22 captured wild rats (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus) from the Caribbean island of St. Kitts for 19 microorganisms. Information gained from such surveillance data would be beneficial in assessing regional public health risks and when implementing routine laboratory rodent health monitoring protocols. ABSTRACT: A pilot seroprevalence study was conducted to document exposure to selected pathogens in wild rats inhabiting the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. Serum samples collected from 22 captured wild rats (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus) were tested for the presence of antibodies to various rodent pathogens using a rat MFI2 serology panel. The samples were positive for cilia-associated respiratory bacillus (13/22; 59.1%), Clostridium piliforme (4/22; 18.2%), Mycoplasma pulmonis (4/22; 18.2%), Pneumocystis carinii (1/22; 4.5%), mouse adenovirus type 2 (16/22; 72.7%), Kilham rat virus (15/22; 68.2%), reovirus type 3 (9/22; 40.9%), rat parvovirus (4/22; 18.2%), rat minute virus (4/22; 18.2%), rat theilovirus (2/22; 9.1%), and infectious diarrhea of infant rats strain of group B rotavirus (rat rotavirus) (1/22; 4.5%). This study provides the first evidence of exposure to various rodent pathogens in wild rats on the island of St. Kitts. Periodic pathogen surveillance in the wild rat population would be beneficial in assessing potential regional zoonotic risks as well as in enhancing the current knowledge when implementing routine animal health monitoring protocols in facilities with laboratory rodent colonies.\",\n        \"publishTime\": \"2019-05-10T00:00:00\",\n        \"authors\": \"Boey, Kenneth; Shiokawa, Kanae; Avsaroglu, Harutyun; Rajeev, Sreekumari\",\n        \"journal\": \"Animals (Basel)\",\n        \"hasFullText\": true,\n        \"fullTextFile\": \"comm_use_subset\",\n        \"url\": \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6562389/\",\n        \"id\": \"000q5l5n\",\n        \"meta\": {\n            \"tenantTagId\": 4,\n            \"tenant\": \"covid\",\n            \"tag\": \"prod\",\n            \"created\": \"2020-04-08T08:10:47Z\",\n            \"createdBy\": \"santiago.lopez@c3iot.com\",\n            \"updated\": \"2020-04-08T08:10:47Z\",\n            \"updatedBy\": \"santiago.lopez@c3iot.com\",\n            \"timestamp\": \"2020-04-08T08:10:47Z\",\n            \"fetchInclude\": \"[]\",\n            \"fetchType\": \"BiblioEntry\"\n        },\n        \"version\": 1\n    },\n  ...\n}\n```\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Fetch metadata for the first two thousand (2000) full text PMC journal articles with full text cc-by license (request only)</summary>\n\n**HTTP URL:**\n`https://api.c3.ai/covid/api/1/biblioentry/fetch`\n\n**Request JSON:**\n```json\n{ // By default the first 2000 records are returned if no \"limit\" is specified.\n  \"spec\": {\n    \"filter\": \"source == 'PMC' && license == 'cc-by' && hasFullText == true\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n",

Estimating the eff ects of smoking and indoor air pollution on COPD and lung cancer requires incorporation of how fast risk accumulates after initiation, or reverses after cessation.

Relative risk at time (t) depends on time since exposure initiation or cessation, because the eff ects of smoking and indoor air pollution accumulate gradually after exposure begins (eg, smoking initiation) and reverse gradually after exposure stops (eg, smoking cessation). 10, 11 We did separate analyses for lung cancer and COPD and for men and women, because they have diff erent relative risks. For both lung cancer and COPD, we fi rst computed PAFs separately for smoking and solid-fuel use. COPD and lung cancer are caused by multiple risk factors acting simultaneously, and hence a proportion of deaths might be prevented by reducing exposure to either factor. 9, 12, 13 For example, some COPD deaths among smokers who cook with solid fuels may be prevented by smoking prevention or by use of clean fuels. As a result of multicausality, the PAFs for multiple risk factors overlap, and cannot be combined by simple addition. We estimated the PAFs for the combined eff ects of smoking and solid fuel, accounting for multicausality and avoiding double-counting the overlap of multiple risk factors: 9, [12] [13] [14] PAF i =PAF of the i th risk factor n=number of risk factors Three conditions must hold when using the above equation. First, exposures to risks should be uncorrelated. The cross-province correlation coeffi cient between solidfuel use and smoking, from the data sources described in webappendix 1, was 0·04 (95% CI -0·32 to 0·40, p=0·82) for men and -0·11 (-0·45 to 0·26, p=0·56) for women, indicating small and non-signifi cant correlation. We also examined individual-level correlation with the 2006 panel from The China Health and Nutrition Survey (a multistage, random cluster survey, including 9788 adults in nine provinces throughout China with signifi cant variation in socioeconomic and health status). 15 61% of men and 4% of women had ever smoked in homes that did not use solid fuels and 63% of men and 4% of women had ever smoked in homes that did. The odds ratios for smoking, comparing solid-fuel users to non-users, was 1·07 (0·95-1·20) for men and 1·02 (0·76-1·36) for women, showing uncorrelated exposures. The second condition is that the hazardous eff ects of one risk are not mediated through other risks. Smoking and solid-fuel combustion are both sources of respirable pollutants, but the eff ects of pollutants from one source are not mediated through exposure to the other. The third condition is that the proportional eff ects of one risk do not depend on exposure to the other risk factor. The proportional mortality study of smoking in China showed that the relative risks of lung cancer and respiratory-disease mortality among Chinese smokers were not modifi ed by background disease levels, 16\",\n            \"cite_spans\": [\n              {\n                \"start\": 181,\n                \"end\": 182,\n                \"text\": \"9\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF5\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 564,\n                \"end\": 567,\n                \"text\": \"10,\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF6\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 568,\n                \"end\": 570,\n                \"text\": \"11\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF7\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 958,\n                \"end\": 960,\n                \"text\": \"9,\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF5\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 961,\n                \"end\": 964,\n                \"text\": \"12,\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF8\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 965,\n                \"end\": 967,\n                \"text\": \"13\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF9\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 1393,\n                \"end\": 1395,\n                \"text\": \"9,\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF5\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 1396,\n                \"end\": 1400,\n                \"text\": \"[12]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF8\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 1401,\n                \"end\": 1405,\n                \"text\": \"[13]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF9\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 1406,\n                \"end\": 1410,\n                \"text\": \"[14]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF10\"\n              }\n            ],\n            \"ref_spans\": [],\n            \"section\": \"Analytical models\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"text\": \"When susceptible (S) individuals are infected, they enter a state of fast latency (L) from which they may experience primary progression to the infectious (I) state.

We introduced smoking and indoor air pollution into the model by stratifying the model population into the four possible combinations of exposure to these risk factors, proportional to their actual (time-varying) prevalence in each province. We fi tted a time-varying transmission parameter, defi ned as the rate at which infectious individuals are able to infect people who are susceptible. Available data and previous modelling suggested that the transmission parameter declined almost linearly in England and Wales from about 20 in 1900 to about 1 at the end of the 20th century. 19 We set the value of the transmission parameter to 20 in 1900, and it declined linearly to an empirically-fi tted lower bound; the rate of decline and the lower bound were fi tted to minimise the root mean square of the diff erences between the modelled and observed tuberculosis prevalence by province. The fi tted lower bound, which determines tuberculosis incidence after 2000, was not sensitive to the initial transmission parameter in 1900. Model fi tting also considered that chemotherapy was unavailable before 1960 20 and that the mean duration of disease is 2 years without treatment, 0·8 years under eff ective DOTS (directly observed treatment, short course), and 1·5 years for programmes other than eff ective DOTS. 21 We applied the calibrated model to estimate future tuberculosis incidence under diff erent scenarios of smoking, solid-fuel use, and DOTS coverage.\",\n            \"cite_spans\": [\n              {\n                \"start\": 295,\n                \"end\": 298,\n                \"text\": \"17,\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF12\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 299,\n                \"end\": 301,\n                \"text\": \"18\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF13\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 1145,\n                \"end\": 1147,\n                \"text\": \"19\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF14\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 1875,\n                \"end\": 1877,\n                \"text\": \"21\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF16\"\n              }\n            ],\n            \"ref_spans\": [],\n            \"section\": \"Figure 1: Compartmental susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered (SLIR) model of tuberculosis infection\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"text\": \"To account for heterogeneity across provinces, we did tuberculsosis analyses at the provincial level.

The future projections of the national population came from the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Aff airs of the UN Secretariat 32 and those of the disease-specifi c mortality from the global burden of disease study conducted by the WHO. Global burden of disease forecasts disease-specifi c mortality on the basis of projections of economic and social development, smoking, obesity, and selected other disease determinants. 1 We constructed scenarios that represent the range of policies and programmes that can reduce smoking and solid-fuel use on the basis of experiences and trends in other countries and some parts of China (tables 1 and 2 and webfi gure 2). All scenarios covered a period of 30 years (2003-33). We constructed prevalence of risk factors over time in the scenarios for each province with a linear time trend, and aggregated the provincial prevalences to the national level. More than 99% of the tobacco market share in China is controlled by the Chinese National Tobacco Corporation. Tobacco prices and taxes are low and there are only a few tobacco control measures in place. 38 However, China ratifi ed the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in October 2005, which came into eff ect in January, 2006. Future smoking prevalence will largely depend on the extent to which economic and regulatory approaches to tobacco control are pursued. Although male and female smoking prevalences probably have common policy determinants, the analyses of lung cancer and chronic disease mortality were done separately for men and women and included all sex-specifi c scenarios. The analysis for tuberculosis was done for men and women combined because relative risks were for both sexes combined and because there are indirect eff ects of smoking on tuberculosis between sexes. National adult smoking prevalence was 49·6% for men and 3·0% for women in 2003 according to the National Health Service Survey. Another National Tobacco Prevalence Survey in 2002 reported current smoking prevalence of 57·4% for men and 2·6% for women. The two surveys had slightly diff erent defi nitions of current smoking. 22, 33 Tobacco consumption per person in China peaked around 1990 and has declined slowly since then. 38 Data from three National Health Service Surveys (1993, 1998, 2003) show that smoking prevalence declined from 60·3% to 49·6% among men (standardised to the 2003 population); smoking in women declined from 4·7% to 3·0% in this period.\",\n            \"cite_spans\": [\n              {\n                \"start\": 89,\n                \"end\": 91,\n                \"text\": \"38\",\n                \"ref_id\": null\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 798,\n                \"end\": 799,\n                \"text\": \"1\",\n                \"ref_id\": null\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 1472,\n                \"end\": 1474,\n                \"text\": \"38\",\n                \"ref_id\": null\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 2490,\n                \"end\": 2493,\n                \"text\": \"22,\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF17\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 2494,\n                \"end\": 2496,\n                \"text\": \"33\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF27\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 2592,\n                \"end\": 2594,\n                \"text\": \"38\",\n                \"ref_id\": null\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 2643,\n                \"end\": 2649,\n                \"text\": \"(1993,\",\n                \"ref_id\": null\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 2650,\n                \"end\": 2655,\n                \"text\": \"1998,\",\n                \"ref_id\": null\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 2656,\n                \"end\": 2661,\n                \"text\": \"2003)\",\n                \"ref_id\": null\n              }\n            ],\n            \"ref_spans\": [],\n            \"section\": \"Moderate rise\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"text\": \"Solid fuels comprise biomass (wood, crop residues, animal dung, and charcoal) and coal and are used for cooking and heating.

But tuberculosis incidence can decline signifi cantly because treatment reduces the risk of infection through reducing the duration of infectiousness. Nonetheless, smoking and solid-fuel interventions should be components of tuberculosis control for at least three reasons. First, irrespective of coverage and eff ectiveness of DOTS, risk-factor interventions can further reduce incidence of tuberculosis. The complementary eff ects of risk-factor interventions occur through reducing the risk of latent infection and progression from latent infection to infectious disease. Second, reducing smoking in patients with tuberculosis might further strengthen DOTS eff ectiveness because smoking has been associated with delayed response to treatment. 63 Third, reducing smoking may itself lower the risk of drug resistance as recent studies have suggested a link between smoking and drug-resistant tuberculosis. 64, 65 Our quantitative analysis of the eff ects of the two leading environmental and lifestyle sources of respirable pollutants on a common set of infectious and chronic diseases used models that incorporated the aetiological risk factors in disease incidence and mortality over time. Specifi cally, our models and data sources accounted for the fact that eff ects on lung cancer and COPD accumulate or reverse gradually after exposure begins or stops and for dependency of tuberculosis incidence on prevalent infectious cases. We used several large sources of data to reconstruct consistent and comparable trends of smoking, solid-fuel use, and tuberculosis in China's provinces. Scenarios were constructed on the basis of policy experiences in China and other countries, and can provide programme targets and benchmarks.

These analyses show that the largest source of uncertainty for COPD and lung cancer is whether the relative risks of smoking related diseases in China will reach those observed in western populations. One recent study in China is consistent with increasing relative risks, 66 but the possibility of ethnic diff erences cannot be ruled out. 67 Benefi ts of tobacco control in diff erent scenarios would be 23-81% smaller for men and 84-94% smaller for women if the relative risks for eff ects of smoking on COPD and lung cancer do not rise signifi cantly after the peak of the smoking epidemic (webfi gure 6).

These analyses show that the largest source of uncertainty for the tuberculosis model is the future trend of transmission parameter, which depends on how sociodemographic change aff ects the patterns of contact and other determinants of transmission in China. If factors such as higher population density and increased travel increase the number of contacts that lead to tuberculosis transmission, the transmission parameter might not continue its expected decline. In this case, reducing smoking and indoor air pollution will have an even greater eff ect on tuberculosis control than estimated. For example, if the transmission parameter in Jiangsu doubles over the next 30 years, the benefi ts of the diff erent scenarios of smoking, solid-fuel use would be 58-77% greater than the original analysis in fi gure 4. Multiparameter uncertainty analysis showed the interquartile range of the estimated eff ects was within 14-33% of its central value in all provinces and in all scenarios of DOTS, smoking, and solid-fuel use. Finally, the causal link between smoking and tuberculosis is based on a larger number of epidemiological studies than that of indoor air pollution from solid-fuel use. If the causal eff ect on tuberculosis were only from smoking, the benefi ts of reducing exposure would be smaller than those in fi gure 4, by 19-37% for diff erent scenarios in Jiangsu, by 23-32% in Guizhou, and by 9-13% in Shanghai. In addition to the above sources of uncertainty, fundamentally new technologies for early detection and treatment of chronic diseases could signifi cantly aff ect future burden. Discovery and large-scale use of such technologies over the duration of our analysis are less likely for COPD, but cannot be ruled out for lung cancer and tuberculosis. Finally, relative risks from meta-analyses may not be generalisable to population-level eff ects; nevertheless, such estimation is necessary and indispensable to inform policy making.\",\n            \"cite_spans\": [],\n            \"ref_spans\": [],\n            \"section\": \"Discussion\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"text\": \"In addition to smoking and solid-fuel use, respiratory diseases are aff ected by other sources of inhaled pollutants, including passive smoking, air pollution from transport and industrial sources, and occupational exposures.

In addition to their disease burden, these diseases have large and inequitable household and societal economic burden associated with health-care costs, reduced labour-market participation, and decreased accumulation of human capital, described in detail elsewhere for China and for other developing countries. [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] Our results show that reducing common risk factors could have a substantial eff ect on future burden of COPD and lung cancer, and be an important contributor to tuberculosis control. Our fi ndings have several potential policy and programme implications at the national, community, household, or individual levels. At the national level, our results on the projected burden of disease from COPD and lung cancer alone reinforce the need for regulatory and economic policies that reduce smoking and promote clean household energy sources in China. Tuberculosis control however cannot rely on risk-factor reduction as its main intervention, and the core of national or regional tuberculosis control programmes should remain interventions that can reduce and eventually interrupt transmission under generalisable circumstances, currently DOTS. Nonetheless, at the community level, some interventions could increase the coverage or community eff ectiveness of others. For example, case detection and treatment completion under DOTS in China have been constrained by limitations of physical and human infrastructure, fi nancial factors, and compliance, especially in rural areas and marginalised social groups. [73] [74] [75] [76] Low-income or marginalised communities could be enrolled in programmes that provide cleaner fuels or stoves and nutritional supplements, conditional on periodic tuberculosis tests and DOTS treatment completion. At the individual level, tobacco cessation can be added to tuberculosis treatment, possibly with fi nancial incentives. 77, 78 If multiple interventions are implemented, the management structure of DOTS, including its standardised approach to registration, recording, and reporting of enrolled individuals (or households) and their status in receiving intervention, can strengthen planning and implementation of interventions for indoor air pollution and smoking. 79 Tobacco taxes might also be used to subsidise DOTS, clean energy technology, and nutrition for low-income households that take part in integrated programmes. An important next step would be a policy dialogue between the diff erent economic, energy, and health-sector agencies in China as well as community-based intervention studies that assess the eff ectiveness of combining risk factor interventions with tuberculosis case fi nding and treatment under actual conditions of implementation.\",\n            \"cite_spans\": [\n              {\n                \"start\": 473,\n                \"end\": 477,\n                \"text\": \"[68]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF62\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 478,\n                \"end\": 482,\n                \"text\": \"[69]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF63\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 483,\n                \"end\": 487,\n                \"text\": \"[70]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF64\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 488,\n                \"end\": 492,\n                \"text\": \"[71]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF65\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 493,\n                \"end\": 497,\n                \"text\": \"[72]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF66\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 1703,\n                \"end\": 1707,\n                \"text\": \"[73]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF67\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 1708,\n                \"end\": 1712,\n                \"text\": \"[74]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF68\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 1713,\n                \"end\": 1717,\n                \"text\": \"[75]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF69\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 1718,\n                \"end\": 1722,\n                \"text\": \"[76]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF70\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 2054,\n                \"end\": 2057,\n                \"text\": \"77,\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF71\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 2058,\n                \"end\": 2060,\n                \"text\": \"78\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF72\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 2398,\n                \"end\": 2400,\n                \"text\": \"79\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF73\"\n              }\n            ],\n            \"ref_spans\": [],\n            \"section\": \"Discussion\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"text\": \"HHL, MM, and ME designed the study and the analyses.

Therefore, surveillance on the prevalence and the virus variation of HCoVs circulation in this region is conducted. Methods: A total of 3298 nasopharyngeal swabs samples were collected from cross-border children (<6 years, crossing border between Southern China and Hong Kong SAR) showing symptoms of respiratory tract infection, such as fever (body temperature > 37.5°C), from 2014 May to 2015 Dec. Viral nucleic acids were analyzed and sequenced to study the prevalence and genetic diversity of the four human coronaviruses. The statistical significance of the data was evaluated with Fisher chi-square test. Results: 78 (2.37%; 95%CI 1.8-2.8%) out of 3298 nasopharyngeal swabs specimens were found to be positive for OC43 (36;1.09%), HKU1 (34; 1.03%), NL63 (6; 0.18%) and 229E (2;0.01%). None of SARS or MERS was detected. The HCoVs predominant circulating season was in transition of winter to spring, especially January and February and NL63 detected only in summer and fall. Complex population with an abundant genetic diversity of coronaviruses was circulating and they shared homology with the published strains (99-100%). Besides, phylogenetic evolutionary analysis indicated that OC43 coronaviruses were clustered into three clades (B,D,E), HKU1 clustered into two clades(A,B) and NL63 clustered into two clades(A,B). Moreover, several novel mutations including nucleotides substitution and the insertion of spike of the glycoprotein on the viral surface were discovered.\",\n            \"cite_spans\": [],\n            \"ref_spans\": [],\n            \"section\": \"Abstract\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"body_text\": [\n          {\n            \"text\": \"Conclusions: The detection rate and epidemic trend of coronaviruses were stable and no obvious fluctuations were found.

Six types of coronaviruses (CoVs) are known to infect human: two α-CoVs, i.e. 229E and NL63, two β-CoVs group A, i.e. HKU1 and OC43, β-CoVs group B, i.e. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and β-CoVs group C, i.e. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are highly pathogenic to human lives and have caused serious diseases or death, causes about 10 and 36% mortality respectively. OC43, HKU1, NL63 and 229E are the most common four HCoVs in most regions, circulating worldwide with a detection rate ranging from 1.1 -8.5% and with variations in their predominantly circulating seasons and strains [2] [3] [4] [5] . HCoVs ranks the third in the detection rate of all 17 respiratory viruses in south of China (Guangzhou) and poses a heavy burden to the health care of children as it is associated with acute upper or lower respiratory tract infections, and cases of death have been reported [6] . Moreover, high mutation rates caused by the low fidelity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) led to high diversity of HCoVs [7] . Several studies about the genetic diversity of human coronaviruses on hospitalized patients had been carried out previously. The new OC43 genotype D based on the recombination of B and C was discovered in 2005 [8] . Two additional recombinants: E (CH) and E (FR) were reported as homologous genome recombination in 2015 [9, 10] . The genetic features of NL63 were reported at least three distinct circulating genotypes (A, B and C) and one recombinant (cluster R) in the United States in 2011 [11] . Meanwhile, HKU1 strains were grouped into three clusters (A, B and C) due to natural recombination [12] . These previous reports focused on hospitalized patients, who have low mobility and seldom cross the border, while this study hereby firstly reports the analysis on crossborder children, mainly including \\\"cross-boundary students\\\", who are born and attend school in Hong Kong but reside in Mainland China [13, 14] . A border still exists between Shenzhen in Mainland China and Hong Kong (SZ-HK port) due to the colonial history, resulting in different health care and education systems [13] . Children had a high incidence of coronaviruses infection and \\\"cross-boundary students\\\" connecting closely Hong Kong and Mainland China will help us understand the epidemic characteristics of coronaviruses in the Pearl River Delta region. New occurrence of infectious coronaviruses and the known pan-coronavirus variation among this region are of our study interest because the coronaviruses have the potential to threaten global health system and no vaccine is currently available [15, 16] . Therefore, surveillance upon human coronaviruses among this region was carried in this study.\",\n            \"cite_spans\": [\n              {\n                \"start\": 225,\n                \"end\": 228,\n                \"text\": \"[1]\",\n                \"ref_id\": null\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 897,\n                \"end\": 900,\n                \"text\": \"[2]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF1\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 901,\n                \"end\": 904,\n                \"text\": \"[3]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF2\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 905,\n                \"end\": 908,\n                \"text\": \"[4]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF3\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 909,\n                \"end\": 912,\n                \"text\": \"[5]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF4\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 1189,\n                \"end\": 1192,\n                \"text\": \"[6]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF5\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 1322,\n                \"end\": 1325,\n                \"text\": \"[7]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF6\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 1538,\n                \"end\": 1541,\n                \"text\": \"[8]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF7\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 1648,\n                \"end\": 1651,\n                \"text\": \"[9,\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF8\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 1652,\n                \"end\": 1655,\n                \"text\": \"10]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF9\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 1821,\n                \"end\": 1825,\n                \"text\": \"[11]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF10\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 1927,\n                \"end\": 1931,\n                \"text\": \"[12]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF11\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 2237,\n                \"end\": 2241,\n                \"text\": \"[13,\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF12\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 2242,\n                \"end\": 2245,\n                \"text\": \"14]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF13\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 2418,\n                \"end\": 2422,\n                \"text\": \"[13]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF12\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 2906,\n                \"end\": 2910,\n                \"text\": \"[15,\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF14\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"start\": 2911,\n                \"end\": 2914,\n                \"text\": \"16]\",\n                \"ref_id\": \"BIBREF15\"\n              }\n            ],\n            \"ref_spans\": [],\n            \"section\": \"(Continued from previous page)\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"text\": \"This was a cross-sectional study in molecular epidemiology for coronaviruses infection, and the minimum sample size of this study was 1683 as determined by Z distribution.

Samples of negative results on influenza were then tested for pan-coronavirus as well as 13 other common respiratory viruses. The qRT-PCR master mixture was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions of qRT-PCR Kit (Quant), mainly contained 20.0 μL buffer and 5.0 μL RNA.

Dr. Aboubacar Kampo said Covid-19 times in Afghanistan worsens the situation for children. Continued conflict and insecurity over the past four decades have impacted on development, resulting to lost livelihoods and increased poverty, especially amongst vulnerable families, with children being the most affected.    He further added there were over 600,000 malnourished children in Afghanistan while over three million children were out of school across the country, even before Covid.    Kampo added that UNICEF was supporting the Ministry of Education on alternative solutions to learning during the school closure and supporting the government to make sure handwashing facilities existed in schools when they do reopen.    UNICEF Afghanistan Representative said the provision of sanitation and hygiene facilities would be supported for children both in schools and community-based education centres. He said it was not known when schools would reopen formally due to the evolving situation. “If it comes in winter season, then we need to get prepared the schools and the kids as well.”    On the other hand, the Ministry of Education (MoE) says they have been working on alternative options for the education system in the country.    Nooria Nehzat, spokeswoman for the MoE, told Pajhwok they conducted short term courses in the open sky where social distancing was also observed nation-wide.    She said the MoE had signed a contract of 3,000 textbooks, videos materials with the education system of Turkey to keep alive the teaching process for primary students in the country.    Meanwhile, Dr. Mirwais Balkhi, the minister of education, says they have been working on a comprehensive education plan which would be implemented in Kabul and in the rest of provinces in near future.\\\"  https://web.archive.org/web/20200604235818/https://www.pajhwok.com/en/2020/05/06/covid-19-pandemic-shouldn%E2%80%99t-hamper-education-afghanistan-unicef\",\n      \"origin\": \"University of Oxford\",\n      \"id\": \"Afghanistan_17c877f89f6b0f34270499298244982a\",\n      \"meta\": {\n        \"tenantTagId\": 4,\n        \"tenant\": \"covid\",\n        \"tag\": \"prod\",\n        \"created\": \"2020-06-06T15:26:45Z\",\n        \"createdBy\": \"dataloader\",\n        \"updated\": \"2020-06-06T15:26:45Z\",\n        \"updatedBy\": \"dataloader\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2020-06-06T15:26:46Z\",\n        \"sourceFile\": \"OxCGRT_PolicyAll_latest.csv\",\n        \"fetchInclude\": \"[]\",\n        \"fetchType\": \"PolicyDetail\"\n      },\n      \"version\": 1\n    },\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"count\": 711,\n  \"hasMore\": false\n}\n\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Example 2: Fetch all banking sector prudential-related policies from World Bank Finance dataset</summary>\n\n**HTTP URL:**\n`https://api.c3.ai/covid/api/1/policydetail/fetch`\n\n\n**Request JSON:**\n```json\n{\n  \"spec\" : {\n    \"filter\": \"contains(policyType, 'Banking Sector') && contains(policySubType, 'Prudential') && contains(lowerCase(origin), 'world bank')\" ,\n    \"limit\": -1\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Response JSON:**\n```json\n{\n  \"objs\": [\n    {\n      \"location\": {\n        \"id\": \"Afghanistan\"\n      },\n      \"startDate\": \"2020-04-09T00:00:00\",\n      \"entryDate\": \"2020-04-17T00:00:00\",\n      \"policyType\": \"Banking Sector\",\n      \"policySubType\": \"Prudential\",\n      \"details\": \"Increased frequency of Financial Stability Committee meetings and daily cashflow reports required from banks\",\n      \"origin\": \"World Bank Finance\",\n      \"id\": \"Afghanistan_697e31b366ea0b4e4e0dc6db1c83b668\",\n      \"meta\": {\n        \"tenantTagId\": 4,\n        \"tenant\": \"covid\",\n        \"tag\": \"prod\",\n        \"created\": \"2020-06-09T03:04:17Z\",\n        \"createdBy\": \"dataloader\",\n        \"updated\": \"2020-06-09T03:04:17Z\",\n        \"updatedBy\": \"dataloader\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2020-06-09T03:04:43Z\",\n        \"sourceFile\": \"covid-fci-data.csv\",\n        \"fetchInclude\": \"[]\",\n        \"fetchType\": \"PolicyDetail\"\n      },\n      \"version\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"location\": {\n        \"id\": \"Afghanistan\"\n      },\n      \"startDate\": \"2020-04-09T00:00:00\",\n      \"entryDate\": \"2020-04-17T00:00:00\",\n      \"policyType\": \"Banking Sector\",\n      \"policySubType\": \"Prudential\",\n      \"details\": \"Relaxation of provisioning requirements for loans that are covered by partial credit guarantees\",\n      \"origin\": \"World Bank Finance\",\n      \"id\": \"Afghanistan_6c6650eec8ec6bc01d427d9d8634b378\",\n      \"meta\": {\n        \"tenantTagId\": 4,\n        \"tenant\": \"covid\",\n        \"tag\": \"prod\",\n        \"created\": \"2020-06-09T03:04:17Z\",\n        \"createdBy\": \"dataloader\",\n        \"updated\": \"2020-06-09T03:04:17Z\",\n        \"updatedBy\": \"dataloader\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2020-06-09T03:04:43Z\",\n        \"sourceFile\": \"covid-fci-data.csv\",\n        \"fetchInclude\": \"[]\",\n        \"fetchType\": \"PolicyDetail\"\n      },\n      \"version\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"location\": {\n        \"id\": \"Afghanistan\"\n      },\n      \"startDate\": \"2020-04-09T00:00:00\",\n      \"entryDate\": \"2020-04-17T00:00:00\",\n      \"policyType\": \"Banking Sector\",\n      \"policySubType\": \"Prudential\",\n      \"details\": \"Suspension of on-site examinations Until June 2020.
